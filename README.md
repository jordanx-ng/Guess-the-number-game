# Guess the Number – Algorithmic Thinking in Python

This project is a simple Python-based interactive game designed to
strengthen algorithmic thinking, control flow, and user interaction.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Random number generation
- Input validation

## Biomedical Relevance
Algorithmic decision-making and control flow are foundational skills
in computational biology, where logic-driven pipelines are used to
process experimental data and guide downstream analysis.

This project builds programming discipline applicable to more complex
biomedical data workflows.
